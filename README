MongoDB + Spring MVC + JQuery Itegration demo

This is a MongoDB + Spring MVC + JQuery integration demo web-app.
It is a simple blog that allows the user to read, create, edit and delete posts  

Spring-data-mongodb is used to create the factory/connection for MongoDB but is not used for MongoDB CRUD templating.
MongoDB CRUD operations are implemented using the MongoDB Java driver.
Spring MVC is used to expose Controller methods as REST services.
JQuery ajax functions are used for calls to the REST services.
Data JSON serialization/deserialization is done using Jackson.
Simple beautification is done using bootstrap.
Dependencies are handled using Maven. 
Dependencies versioning is handled by Spring IO Platform.
